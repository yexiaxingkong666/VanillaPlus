Vanilla Minecraft is too easy (salute MITE). VanillaPlus can fix this problem. 

### Is it a large datapack? Can my computer run it?

Don't worry. It's very lightweight, so you can run it on all the computers (maybe, if you are using an computer from ancient times, forget it...).

Minecraft Java Edition 1.18+. Different versions will have different effects (maybe). I recommend you to use the latest version.
